#  Simulation of N=200 active particles interacting with the 
#  soft-core potential confined on the surface of the xy plane
#  


# All runtime messages will be sent to file messages.msg
messages messages.msg

# Every simulation requires a box
# "periodic" means that periodic boundary are applied.
# box is cubic with size 10x10x10 (Lennard-Jones units) and spans from -5 to 5 in 
# each direction 
box periodic { lx = 10.0;  ly = 10.0;  lz = 10.0 }

# We read in particle positions from file plane.dat (generated by tools in utils directory)
input plane.dat

# We set the neighbour list with cutoff distance 1.5 and padding distance of 0.5
nlist { rcut = 1.5; pad = 0.5 }

# In following we define different data outputs

# Output particle velocities. Base name of the file is plane_test
# File extension will we '.vel'. Output will be generated every 10000 time steps
# staring from the step 0. Each snapshots will be stored in a separate file (keyword 'multi')
# with name plane_test_[time_step].vel (e.g., plane_test_0000010000.vel)
# and each file with contain a header with the description of its content
dump plane_test { type=velocity; start=0; freq=10000; multi; header }

# Same as above, but the format will be XYZ and file extension '.xyz'
dump plane_test { type=xyz; start=0; freq=10000; multi; header }

# In order to generate a trajectory, we output coordinates every 1000 time steps
# In this case all snapshots will be stored in one file 'plane_test.dcd'
dump plane_test { type=dcd; start=0; freq=1000  }

# Finally, every 10000 steps we generate a separate file that contains only 
# particle coordinates (and the header)
dump plane_test { type=full; start=0; freq=10000; multi; coordinate; header  }


# We constrain all particles to move only on the xy plane with lx=10, ly = 10 (actually those are read from the box)
constraint plane { lx = 10; ly = 10 }


# All particles are interacting with the soft-core potential of strength 
# k = 1.0 (energy units)
pair_potential soft { k = 1.0 }

# Integrate equations of motion using Brownian dynamics.
# seed is the initial seed for the random number generator
# dt is the integrator time step (in Lennard-Jones units) 
# nu sets the width of the distribution for random changes of velocity
# mu is particle mobility
# v0 is the intensity of the self-propelling velocity
integrator brownian { dt=0.001; seed = 1;  nu = 1.0; mu = 1.0;  v0 = 1.0 }

# Finally, we run simulation for 100,000 time steps
run 100000
