OS

The code has been developed and tested under Linux. Porting it to
work on Mac OS X should be straightforward. In principle code should 
be able to run on Windows as well, but it would require modifying the
CMake build scripts that are currently only written for Linux.

REQUIREMENTS

* Modern C++ compiler (however, no C++11 features have been used, so something like g++ 4.4 should be fine)
* Boost libraries (1.48 or newer, in particular Spirit parser)
* GNU Scientific Library (GSL) - version 1.13 or newer 
* CMake (2.8 or newer)
* Doxygen - optional 
* LaTeX support for Doxygen (for building PDF reference manual) - optional
* graphviz library (for building UML diagrams in the documentation) - optional 

COMPILING 

1. Unpack code with 

tar xjvf apcs.tar.bz2

2. cd APCS
3. mkdir build
4. cd build
5. ccmake ../
6. Use the CMake GUI to chose appropriate settings
7. Hit 'c' a couple of times followed by 'g'
8. make -j 8  (on a 4-core CPU)

This should build executable called 'apcs'.

RUNNING

The code requires two files to run:

1. conf file containing simulation parameters, force field, integrator type, etc.
2. data file containing initial position of particles (see utils directory for tool to generate those)

code is executed with 

./apcs conf_file.conf
