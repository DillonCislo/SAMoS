This folder contains python analysis code of the particle-vertex model.

This code uses scipy.Delaunay for triangulation and the python bindings of OpenMesh (http://www.openmesh.org/).
Installing the OpenMesh package also installs the python bindings by default.

IMPORTANT
The triangulation produced by scipy.Delaunay is not automatically oriented by default for atleast scipy 0.13 and lower.
Upgrading to the latest stable version, 0.17.0, fixes the problem and this is currently a requirement for the code.
