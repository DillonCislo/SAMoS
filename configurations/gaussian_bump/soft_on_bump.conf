#  Simulation of N=786 active particles interacting with the 
#  soft-core potential confined on the surface of a Gaussian bump
#  


# All runtime messages will be sent to file messages.msg
messages messages.msg

# Every simulation requires a box
# "periodic" means that periodic boundary are applied.
# box is cubic with size 50x50x50 (units of particle radius r = 1) and spans from -50 to 50 in 
box periodic { lx = 50.0;  ly = 50.0;  lz = 50.0 }

# We read in particle positions from file bump.dat (generated by tools in utils directory)
input bump.dat

# We set the neighbour list with cutoff distance 2.4 and padding distance of 0.5
nlist { rcut = 2.5; pad = 0.5 }


# In following we define different data outputs

# Output particle velocities. Base name of the file is bump_test
# File extension will we '.vel'. Output will be generated every 10000 time steps
# staring from the step 0. Each snapshots will be stored in a separate file (keyword 'multi')
# with name bump_test_[time_step].vel (e.g., bump_test_0000010000.vel)
# and each file with contain a header with the description of its content
dump bump_test { type=velocity; start=0; freq=10000; multi; header }

# Same as above, but the format will be XYZ and file extension '.xyz'
dump bump_test { type=xyz; start=0; freq=10000; multi; header }

# We also want to generate a director field file that can be directly visualized by SimRePlay
# In this case all snapshots will be stored in one file 'bump_test_dir.xyzv'
dump bump_test_dir { type=xyzv; start=0; freq=1000; scale = 0.25; header  }

# In addition we want to generate a velocity field file that can be directly visualized by SimRePlay
# In this case all snapshots will be stored in one file 'bump_test_vel.xyzv'
dump bump_test_vel { type=xyzv; start=0; freq=1000; scale = 0.1; velocity; header  }


# Finally, every 10000 steps we generate a separate file that contains 
# particle coordinates, velocities anf the director field (and the header)
dump bump_test { type=full; start=0; freq=1000; multi; coordinate; velocity; director; header  }


# We constrain all particles to move only on the xy bump with lx=100, ly = 100 (actually those are read from the box)
constraint gaussian_bump { A = 3.0; a = 8.0; b = 8.0 }


# All particles are interacting with the soft-core potential of strength 
# k = 1.0 (energy units)
pair_potential soft { k = 0.0 }



# Alignment will be done using polar aligner 
# Coupling constant J = 0.25 (energy units)
pair_align polar { J = 1.0 }


# In order to relax the system and remove large overlaps 
# we first run system using NVE integrator with maximum 
# displacement limit=0.001. Time step is dt = 0.001
integrator nve { dt=0.001; limit=0.0001 }


# Run for 10,000 steps
run 10000

disable nve { group=all }

# Now we are at the point to execute actual simulations. 
# We switch the integrator to brownian.
# Integrate equations of motion using Brownian dynamics.
# seed is the initial seed for the random number generator
# dt is the integrator time step (in Lennard-Jones units) 
# nu sets the width of the distribution for random changes of velocity
# mu is particle mobility
# v0 is the intensity of the self-propelling velocity
integrator brownian { dt=0.001; seed = 1;  nu = 0.1; mu = 1.0;  v0 = 0.5; group = all }


# Finally, we run simulation for 100,000 time steps
run 1000000
